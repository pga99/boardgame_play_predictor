# Boardgame play predictor

Built this `Streamlit` app as a birthday present to my wife to use predict the winner of a boardgame match. 
Based on data collected with the [Board Game Stats app](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/) from January 2019 to August 2021. 
Board game information comes from [the bgg data from Board Game data set on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mshepherd/board-games).
